                            <p>
                                Occasionally, PatronCastle may offer specific services for a fee as part of the PatronCastle's Service ("Paid Services"). The subsequent terms of sale exclusively pertain to your acquisition of Paid Services from PatronCastle.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Pricing</h5>
                            <p>
                                Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by PatronCastle, the fees for any Paid Services ("Fees") will be clearly specified through the PatronCastle Service. All Fees are expressed in U.S. dollars and do not include any applicable taxes.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Payment Method</h5>
                            <p>
                                You may only make payments for Fees using valid payment methods that we accept, as indicated on the PatronCastle Service. By designating a payment method, you confirm that you are authorized to use it.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You grant us permission to charge the total amount, including applicable taxes and other charges, to your designated payment method. If the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is otherwise unacceptable to us, your order may be suspended or canceled.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Subscriptions</h5>
                            <p>
                                Some of the Paid Services offered by PatronCastle may be available on a subscription basis with automatic renewal of payments ("Subscription Services"). The billing cycle for each type of Subscription Service will be specified on the PatronCastle Service at the time of registration.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When you subscribe to any Subscription Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree to the below:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>PatronCastle (or its designated third-party payment processor) is authorized to charge you on a recurring basis for the Subscription Service (in addition to any applicable taxes and other charges) at the then-current rates for as long as the Subscription Service continues.</li>
                                <li>The Subscription Service will continue until you cancel it or we suspend or terminate access to the PatronCastle Service in accordance with these Terms.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h5>Cancellation Policy for Subscription Services</h5>
                            <p>
                                To cancel any Subscription Service, you must contact us through our Help Center via our mobile app or website and follow the instructions provided in the email response to your cancellation request.                                 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Cancellation must be completed before the start of the next billing period to avoid charges for the upcoming billing period's Fees. After cancellation, you will retain access to the Subscription Services (subject to these Terms) until the conclusion of your current billing period.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Price Adjustments</h5>
                            <p>
                                PatronCastle reserves the right to alter the Fees for any Paid Services, including Subscription Services, at its sole discretion. For Subscription Services, any price changes will be effective from the next billing cycle.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Taxes</h5>
                            <p>
                                You are responsible for any applicable sales, duty, or other government taxes or fees related to your purchase of Paid Services. We will collect any applicable sales tax if required, and such taxes will be disclosed at the time of your order placement.
                            </p>

                            <h5>No Refunds</h5>
                            <p>
                                Except as specified in Section 5(H) or as otherwise agreed upon by PatronCastle, all sales of Paid Services (including Subscription Services) are considered final, and refunds are not provided. Partially used Subscription Services periods are not eligible for refunds or credits.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Errors</h5>
                            <p>
                                In the event of an error related to the pricing or billing of Paid Services, we reserve the right to correct the error and adjust your order accordingly (including charging the accurate price) or cancel the purchase and refund any overcharged amount.                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your sole remedy for billing errors is to obtain a refund for the excess amount charged. To qualify for such a refund, you must report the error within 100 days from the date of the billing statement where the error initially appeared.
                            </p>
